# Tiffin — User Guide (v2, native app)

For the people running the canteen day to day. The system is now a single
**app** (`Tiffin`) installed on every device — no browser, no
laptop required. The product rules (units, meal windows, grace allowance, scan
reversal, billing) are unchanged from v1; see `docs/PRD.md` §5–§8.

---

## 1. Roles

| Role | Who | Can do |
|---|---|---|
| **Admin** | The contractor | Everything: members, top-ups & billing, top-up history & reversal, QR codes, menu planning, kitchen setup (ingredients + recipes), purchase schedule, expenses, refunds, settings, scan reversal, user accounts. |
| **Counter** | Billing-counter staff | Scan, top-ups & billing, and the shared purchase schedule. Nothing else. |
| **Scanner** | Meal-serving staff | Scan only. |

Students and staff are **records**, not logins — they carry a QR code and get
scanned.

## 2. First-time setup

### 2.1 Pick a host device

One phone is the **host**: it holds the database and serves the others. Pick
the phone that stays at the canteen and is on power during meal times —
**preferably an Android phone** (an iPhone host can only serve while the app
is open on screen; see 2.4).

1. Install and open the app on that phone.
2. On the setup screen, tap **Run as host**.
3. **Set up this host** appears: choose the admin username (`admin` by
   default) and a password. **Suggest a strong one** fills both boxes and
   shows the password so you can write it down — it is stored only as a
   one-way hash, so nobody, including the app, can read it back later.
4. Tap **Create admin & continue**. You are signed straight in, and the server
   starts serving on the Wi-Fi on its own — there is no separate "start
   server" step.

Both the username and the password can be changed later from **Users**. If the
admin password is ever lost, **Forgot the password?** on the host device's own
sign-in screen will set a new one (host device only, never over the network).

Every other device installs the same app and taps **Run as client**, then
picks the host from the list. If it doesn't appear (some routers block
device-to-device discovery), tap **Connect by IP address** and type the
host's address — see it on the host under **Admin ▸ Hosting & LAN**.

You can change a device's role later from the ↔ icon in the top bar.

### 2.2 Managing the host (Admin ▸ Hosting & LAN)

Sign in on the host as **admin** and open **Settings ▸ Hosting & LAN**. It
shows:

- whether the server is **serving**, and the exact URL(s) other devices use;
- **Stop / Restart** serving (rarely needed — it auto-starts);
- **Generate certificate** for optional HTTPS (see 2.3);
- the keep-awake reminder (2.4).

The admin dashboard shows a yellow banner if the host is *not* serving.

### 2.3 Scanning

Scanning uses the phone camera directly — grant the camera permission when
asked. There is **no HTTPS requirement** for scanning.

### 2.4 Desktop admin (browser)

For heavy data entry, a full admin runs in a desktop browser — served by the
host phone itself. Under **Admin ▸ Hosting & LAN**, the **DESKTOP ADMIN** box
shows the exact URL(s), e.g.:

```
http://192.168.1.42:8710/
```

Open that on any computer on the same Wi-Fi and sign in with an **admin** (or
**counter**) account. It covers everything except scanning: members, top-ups
& billing, top-up history & reversal, scan log & reversal, menu calendar
(month grid), categories, ingredients, recipes, purchase schedule, expenses,
refunds, settings, users.
Bill PDFs open in a new tab. Use the plain `http://` URL — it's faster than
the HTTPS one.

**Optional HTTPS:** tap **Generate certificate** under Hosting & LAN, then
**Restart** serving. The server then *also* listens on `https://<ip>:8711/`.
Phones always use the HTTP port, so a cert never affects phone-to-phone use.
The HTTPS URL still shows a browser "not trusted" warning the first time each
computer connects — only a real CA removes that.

### 2.5 No Wi-Fi? Serve from the host's own hotspot (Android)

Under **Admin ▸ Hosting & LAN**, **Start hotspot** makes the Android host
broadcast its own private Wi-Fi — no router, no internet. It shows the
network name, password, and a QR the other phones can scan to join. Once
they're on it, they pick the host from the list, or use **Connect by IP →
192.168.49.1**. Starting the hotspot turns this phone's normal Wi-Fi off
while it's running. (iPhone can't do this — use its built-in Personal
Hotspot from iOS Settings instead.)

### 2.6 Keeping the host awake

While serving, the app keeps the screen from timing out.

- **Android:** a persistent notification + foreground service keep the server
  running even with the screen off. Allow the notification permission when
  asked. Keep the phone on power and on Wi-Fi; don't "force stop" the app.
- **iPhone:** iOS **cannot** keep the server running in the background. Leave
  the app open and on screen for the whole meal service — locking the phone
  or switching apps stops the server and every client drops. iOS also can't
  create its own Wi-Fi: everyone must be on the same router, or turn on
  **Personal Hotspot** (Settings ▸ Personal Hotspot) and have the other
  phones join it. For a full shift, host on Android.

This is shown as a banner on the iPhone during host setup and under Hosting
& LAN.

## 3. Daily use

### 3.1 Scan (counter / scanner / admin)

Open **Scan**, point at the QR. The verdict fills the screen:

- **Green ACCEPTED** — name, meal, units left. A yellow **ON GRACE ALLOWANCE**
  badge means the balance went negative.
- **Red REJECTED** — the reason in plain words (unknown code, inactive member,
  no meal being served now, already collected today, no units left).

Tap **Next** for the next person. A member can only be scanned once per meal
per day.

### 3.2 Top-up & bill (counter / admin)

**Top-up & bill** → tap the member field to open a searchable picker (name,
class, roll number or staff ID). Not on the list yet? **+ New member** adds a
walk-up member without leaving the screen. Then set units per meal type with
+/− → pick **Cash** or **UPI**. The amount is calculated from the unit prices
in Settings — you never type it. **Charge & generate bill** credits the
balance immediately and shows the bill. For UPI it also shows a payment QR for
the payer to scan; once the money lands, tap **Mark received**.

The **History** tab (same screen) lists every top-up, newest first.
**Reverse** on a top-up subtracts the units it credited back off the member
and records the reversal (who, when). The row stays, marked reversed — it is
never deleted. A reversal is refused once any of those units have been used;
process a **Refund** instead.

### 3.3 Members (admin)

**Members** → **New** for a student (class + roll) or staff (staff ID).
Tap a member to edit, set them inactive, or set a per-member grace override.
**Credit** adds units without a bill. **QR** shows the printable code — it
never changes, so reprinting a lost card is safe.

### 3.4 Scan log & reversal (admin)

**Scan log** lists recent scans. **Reverse** on an accepted scan within the
configured window (Settings → reversal window) restores the unit. The scan
row stays in the log, marked reversed.

### 3.5 Menu, kitchen setup, purchase schedule (admin; counter co-manages the schedule)

- **Menu calendar** — tap a day, then **Add**: pick the meal, type the items
  (comma-separated), and optionally tag categories. A meal plus its items is
  enough — categories are optional, and you can create one with **New
  category** right in the dialog. The **⊞ categories** button in the top bar
  opens the full list (rename / delete); it's also under **Settings ▸ Menu
  categories**. Your own list — Jain, Normal, Staff…

- **Kitchen setup** — two tabs, done once at setup:
  - **Ingredients** — your master shopping list. Each has a name and the
    **unit** you buy it in, chosen from a short list (kg, litre, packet…) or
    **Custom**.
  - **Recipes** — "when the menu says *Veg Pulao*, that needs Rice 2, Onion
    1…". A dish name linked to the ingredients it uses, each with a **quantity
    number** in that ingredient's unit. You can create a missing ingredient
    without leaving the recipe form.
- **Purchase schedule** — the ↻ / generate action reads the menu calendar for
  a date range, looks up each dish's recipe, and rolls the ingredients into a
  dated shopping checklist (safe to re-run — it never duplicates or un-checks
  anything). If it adds nothing it tells you which link is missing. Admin and
  counter can check items off and add one-off items with the **+** button
  (pick the ingredient, type a quantity — its unit is shown).

**The chain:** Menu calendar (what's cooked) + Recipes (what each dish needs)
→ Purchase schedule (what to buy).

### 3.6 Expenses, refunds (admin)

- **Expenses & revenue** — log expenses; the top strip shows revenue
  (confirmed top-ups), expenses, and profit for the period.
- **Refunds** — deduct units from a leaving member and record it. Units
  pre-fill from their balance and can't exceed it. The actual payout happens
  outside the app.

### 3.7 Notifications

The bell in the top bar shows prep reminders (before a planned meal's window)
and purchase-due reminders. Dismissing one only hides it for you.

### 3.8 Settings (admin)

Settings is a short menu of rows, not one long form. Each opens its own screen:

- **Canteen configuration** — app name, unit prices, meal windows, timezone,
  grace allowance, scan-reversal window, reminder lead times, UPI. All runtime,
  no reinstall; one **Save** button, kept in reach at the bottom.
- **Users & access** — see 3.9.
- **Menu categories** — the tag list for menu entries (also editable from the
  menu planner's top bar).
- **Appearance** — see 3.10.
- **Hosting & LAN** *(host only)* — start/stop serving, URLs, certificate.
- **Reports** *(host only)* — see 3.11.
- **Backup & restore** *(host only)* — see 3.11.
- **Switch device role** — host ↔ client; signs you out, touches no data.
- **Reset all data** *(host only)* — wipes this host, no undo.

### 3.9 Users & access (admin — inside Settings)

Add accounts, change usernames, change roles, reset passwords, deactivate.
You can't deactivate or delete your own account.

### 3.10 Appearance (everyone, per device)

**⋮ ▸ Appearance** in the top bar, or **Settings ▸ Appearance**.

- **Theme** — Neobrutal, Clean, Frost or Clay, each previewed live.
- **Light or dark** — or follow the phone's own setting.
- **Animations** — turn them off entirely. Your phone's own "reduce motion"
  accessibility setting always wins, whatever is chosen here.

Each phone keeps its own choice. An admin can make every device match: turn on
**Use this look everywhere** at the bottom of the screen. Devices then show the
host's look, and say so rather than quietly ignoring taps.

The same screen lists **saved logins** and clears them.

### 3.11 Reports, and Backup & restore (admin, host only — two screens under Settings)

**Reports** — an `.xlsx` for Excel or Google Sheets, with a tab per area
(summary, members, balances, scans, top-ups, refunds, expenses, menu). Pick a
date range and which tabs you want, then it goes out through the normal share
sheet. It is for reading and printing; it is *not* a way to put data back —
that is what **Backup & restore** is for.

**Backup** — a complete copy of the canteen in one `.tiffin` file: members,
balances, history, settings and accounts. Use it to move to a new phone, or to
recover from a lost one.

- Leave **Protect with a password** on unless you have a reason not to. The
  file holds member names and account details. Write the password down —
  without it the backup cannot be opened by anyone, including you.
- **Restore from a backup** replaces *everything* on this device. It shows
  what the file contains first and asks you to type REPLACE. Your current data
  is kept beside the restored copy rather than deleted.

Take a backup before changing phones, and keep one somewhere off the phone.

### 3.12 Staying signed in

A phone remembers who signs in on each host it has used, so returning to a
known host skips the login form. Usernames are always remembered; a password
is only kept if you tick **Remember password on this device**. Clear any of it
from **Appearance ▸ Saved logins**.

Because hosts are recognised by identity rather than address, this keeps
working when the router hands the host a different IP — and a phone used at two
canteens keeps both sets of accounts.

## 4. If something's wrong

- **A client says "host unreachable"** — the host phone is off, asleep, on a
  different Wi-Fi, or (iPhone) the app was backgrounded. Wake it, check
  **Admin ▸ Hosting & LAN** shows *serving*, and tap **Retry** / **Find host
  again**. If discovery won't find it, use **Connect by IP address**.
- **Camera won't open** — grant the camera permission in the OS settings for
  Tiffin.
- **Host logs** — the host writes a rolling log file on its own storage
  (`logs/app.log` under the app's documents directory) recording every scan,
  top-up, refund, and admin action.
